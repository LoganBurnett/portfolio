              <p>
                This is an ASP.NET site for an online storefront that incorporates user identity allowing for different functionality based on 
                admin permissions. Customers can add items to their cart, increase/decrease each items quantity, and checkout their order. Admins 
                can update and add new products, categories, and manufacturers as well as manage users and user roles. The site also has full 
                Stripe functionality to process payments and uses an email sender to confirm customer's orders.

              <h3>California Speed Game</h3>
              <p>
                This is an app for playing the card game California Speed, which incorporates drag-and-drop functionality for moving the cards into piles.
                The app also uses sockets to let two users on the same network play the game against each other. Once the game finishes, the players 
                are each asked for their names, then that game's information is stored in a Mongo database and displayed for the users to see.
              </p>
              <ul class="work__list">
                My Contributions:
                <li>The drag-and-drop functionality and display for the cards and piles</li>
                <li>All of the sockets functionality</li>
                <li>The game history page</li>
                <li>Some of the game logic, including the card shuffling algorithm</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                One of the technical challenges we overcame during this project was differentiating between the players, which we solved by 
                using each player's socket id in a key value pair with their player number.

              <h3>Banking App</h3>
              <p>
                This is a relatively simplified concept for a banking app. The user can sign up and log into an account, which provides them with
                a checking, savings, and credit account. The user can then choose to deposit, withdraw, and/or transfer money between their accounts, 
                which will then show up on their transaction history page. The app uses sha256 hashing and salting on each user's password and stores
                them in a MongoDB database. It also uses sessions to track the user across pages and ensure that their secure information is only 
                accessible when they are properly logged in.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is an app to play the game of Hangman. The user enters their name, then a random word is chosen from the database and 
                its length is sent back and displayed for them to start guessing letters. Once the game is finished, their score is put 
                into the Mongo database and the highscores for each word length are displayed.

              <p>
                This is a simple number guessing game that was made to learn server-side components with Express. The app prompts the user for 
                a name and generates a random number between 1 and 100 on the backend. The user then submits guesses until they are correct, then 
                their score is stored in a Mongo database, which is then displayed in a highscores table.

                This is a simple connect four game made to learn and familiarize myself with the basics of React. 
                The app automatically changes turns, can find the winner of the game in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction, and also accounts for the possibility of a tie.
